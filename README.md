Python RPG Game

## This is my take on a text based rpg game

In this program i have decided to try and learn a couple things. I learned how to set up and do hash checking via client-server, it is a very simple prosess, unencrypted. I have also decided to use json as the way to save and load files as it is easily managed and updated via pandas. pandas also has the useful function of converting dataframes to json files.
